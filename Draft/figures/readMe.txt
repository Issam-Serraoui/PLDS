A Few Notes On Figures:
1. Figures are copied from folder: ../Figures/pdf/ and ../Figures/png/.
2. Some figures are renamed with shorter names, as detailed below:

low-d-simulation.pdf (Renamed, Originally: p-300-d-10-T-100-sim1-plot.pdf)
high-d-simulation.pdf (Generate this figure is very time consuming, contact Shaojie Chen (schen89@jhu.edu) for details)
heatmap-figure-1.pdf (Renamed, Originally: p-300-d-10-T-100-sim2-heatmap.pdf)
est-pred-accuracy.pdf (Renamed, Originally: p-300-d-10-T-100-sim3-accuracy.pdf)
