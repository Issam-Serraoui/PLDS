\begin{abstract}
High-dimensional time-series data from a wide variety of domains, such as neuroscience, are being generated every day. Fitting statistical models to such data, to enable parameter estimation and time-series prediction, is an important computational primitive. Existing methods, however, are unable to cope with the high-dimensional nature of these data, due to both computational and statistical reasons.  We mitigate both kinds of issues by proposing an M-estimator for Reduced-rank System IDentification (\mrsid). A combination of low-rank approximations, $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ penalties, and some numerical linear algebra tricks, yields an estimator that is computationally efficient and numerically stable.  Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in a variety of problems.  In particular, we demonstrate that \mrsid~can accurately estimate spatial filters, connectivity graphs, and time-courses from native resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging data. \mrsid~therefore enables big time-series data to be analyzed using standard methods, readying the field for further generalizations including nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models.

%\end{itemize}
High-dimensional  time-series data are becoming increasingly  abundant across a wide variety of domains, spanning economics \cite{Johansen1988}, neuroscience \citep{Friston2003a},   and cosmology \citep{Xie2013a}. Fitting statistical models to such data, to enable parameter estimation and time-series prediction, is an important computational primitive.
Linear dynamical system (LDS) models are amongst the most popular and powerful, because of their intuitive nature and ease of implementation \citep{Kalman1963}.   The famous Kalman Filter-Smoother is one of the most popular and powerful tools for time-series prediction with an LDS, given known parameters \citep{Kalman1960a}.

%
% ^ <joshuav@gmail.com> 2016-05-12T03:59:31.456Z.
In practice, however, for many LDS's, the parameters are unknown and must be estimated in a process often called \emph{system identification} \citep{Ljung1998}.  To the best of our knowledge, currently there does not exist a methodology that provides parameter estimates and predictions from ultra-high-dimensional time-series data (e.g. $p > 10$,$000$).

The challenges associated with high-dimensional time-series estimation and prediction are multifold.  First, na\"ively, such models include dense $p \times p$ matrices, which are often too large to store, much less invert in memory.  Several recent efforts to invert large sparse matrices using a series of computational tricks show promise, though they are still extremely computationally expensive  \citep{Hsieh2013, Banerjee2013a}.

%
% > such naive
%
% Discuss: This was originally "naively such models...", need to confirm if this language is equivalent.
%
% ^ <joshuav@gmail.com> 2016-05-12T04:00:40.851Z.
Second, estimators behave poorly due to numerical instability.
Reduced-rank LDS models can partially address this problem by reducing the number of latent states.  \citep{CHEN1989}.  However, without further constraints, the dimensionality of the latent states would be reduced to such an extent  that it would significantly decrease the predictive capacity of the resulting model.  Third, even after addressing these problems, the time to compute all the necessary quantities can be overly burdensome. Distributed memory implementations, such as those built with Spark, might help overcome this problem. However, it would lead to additional costs and set-up burden, as it would require a Spark cluster \citep{Zaharia2010}.

We address all three of these issues with our M-estimator for Reduced-rank  System IDentification (\mrsid).  By assuming the dimensionality of the latent state space is small (i.e. reduced-rank), relative to the observed space dimensionality, we can significantly improve computational tractability and estimation accuracy. By further penalizing the estimators, with $\ell_1$ and/or $\ell_2$ penalties, via utilizing prior knowledge on the structure of the parameters, we gain further estimation accuracy in this high-dimensional but relatively low-sample size regime.  Finally, by employing several numerical linear algebra tricks, we can reduce the computational burden significantly.

These three techniques combined enable us to obtain highly accurate estimates in a variety of simulation settings.  \mrsid~is, in fact, a generalization of the now classic Baum-Welch expectation maximization algorithm, commonly used for system identification in much lower dimensional linear dynamical systems \citep{rabiner1989tutorial}. We show numerically that the hyperparameters can be selected to minimize prediction error on held-out data.  Finally, we use \mrsid~to estimate functional connectomes from the motor cortex.  \mrsid~enables us to estimate the regions, rather than imposing some prior parcellation on the data, as well as estimate sparse connectivity between regions.  \mrsid~reliably estimates these connectomes, as well as predicts the held-out time-series data.  To our knowledge, this is the first time a single unified approach has been used to estimate partitions and functional connectomes directly from the high-dimensional data.

This work presents a new analysis of a model which has only been implemented in low-dimensional settings,
and paves the way for high-dimensional implementation. Though primitive, it is a first step for essentially any high-dimensional time series analysis, control system identification, and spatiotemporal analysis. To enable extensions, generalizations, and additional applications, the code for the core functions and generating each of the figures is freely available on Github (\url{https://github.com/shachen/PLDS/}).

\section{The first page}
Avoid using abbreviations in the title. Next, list all authors with
their first names or initials and surnames (in that order). Indicate
the author for correspondence (see elsarticle documentation).

Present addresses can be inserted as footnotes. After having listed all
authors' names, you should list their respective affiliations. Link
authors and affiliations using superscript lower case letters.

\subsection{The Abstract}
An Abstract is required for every paper; it should succinctly summarize
the reason for the work, the main findings, and the conclusions of the
study. The abstract should be no longer than 200 words. Do not include
artwork, tables, elaborate equations or references to other parts of
the paper or to the reference listing at the end. ``Comment'' papers
are exceptions, where the commented paper should be referenced in full
in the Abstract.

The reason is that the Abstract should be understandable in itself to
be suitable for storage in textual information retrieval systems.

\textit{Example of an abstract: A biometric sample collected in an
uncontrolled outdoor environment varies significantly from its
indoor version. Sample variations due to outdoor environmental
conditions degrade the performance of biometric systems that
otherwise perform well with indoor samples. In this study, we
quantitatively evaluate such performance degradation in the case
of a face and a voice biometric system. We also investigate how
elementary combination schemes involving min-max or z
normalization followed by the sum or max fusion rule can
improve performance of the multi-biometric system. We use
commercial biometric systems to collect face and voice samples
from the same subjects in an environment that closely mimics the
operational scenario. This realistic evaluation on a dataset of
116 subjects shows that the system performance degrades in
outdoor scenarios but by multimodal score fusion the
performance is enhanced by 20\%. We also find that max rule
fusion performs better than sum rule fusion on this dataset. More
interestingly, we see that by using multiple samples of the same
biometric modality, the performance of a unimodal system can
approach that of a multimodal system.}

\section{The main text}

\subsection{Tables, figures and schemes}
Graphics and tables may be positioned as they should appear in the
final manuscript. Figures, Schemes, and Tables should be numbered.
Structures in schemes should also be numbered consecutively, for ease
of discussion and reference in the text. \textcolor{newcolor}{\bf
Figures should be maximum half a page size.}
All numbers and letters in figures and diagrams should be at least of
the same font size as that of the figure caption.

Depending on the
amount of detail, you can choose to display artwork in one column (20
pica wide) or across the page (42 pica wide). Scale your artwork in
your graphics program before incorporating it in your text. If the
artwork turns out to be too large or too small, resize it again in your
graphics program and re-import it. The text should not run along the
sides of any figure. This is an example for citation \citep{StrunkWhite1979}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{prletfig01}
\caption{Studio setup for capturing face images indoor. Three light
sources L1, L2, L3 were used in conjunction with normal office lights.}
\end{figure}

You might find positioning your artwork within the text difficult
anyway. In that case you may choose to place all artwork at the end of
the text and insert a marker in the text at the desired place. In any
case, please keep in mind that the placement of artwork may vary
somewhat in relation to the page lay-out \citep{MettamAdams1999}.

This can easily be achieved using \verb+endfloat.sty+ package. Please
refer the following documentation to use this package.
\makeatletter
\if@twocolumn
\begin{verbatim}
  http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/
  endfloat/endfloat.pdf
\end{verbatim}
\else
\begin{verbatim}
  http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/endfloat.pdf
\end{verbatim}
\fi
\makeatother

\textcolor{newcolor}{\bf You should insert a caption for the figures
below the figures and for the tables the caption should be above the
tables.}

Please remember that we will always also need highresolution versions
of your artwork for printing, submitted as separate files in standard
format (i.e. TIFF or EPS), not included in the text document. Before
preparing your artwork, please take a look at our Web page:
\url{http://www.elsevier.com/locate/authorartwork}.


\subsection{Lists}

For tabular summations that do not deserve to be presented as
a table, lists are often used. Lists may be either numbered or
bulleted. Below you see examples of both.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first entry in this list
\item The second entry
\begin{enumerate}
\item A subentry
\end{enumerate}
\item The last entry
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item A bulleted list item
\item Another one
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Conventionally, in mathematical equations, variables and
anything that represents a value appear in italics.
All equations should be numbered for easy referencing. The number
should appear at the right margin.
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm pg}'=\frac{S_{\rm pg}-\min(S_{\rm pG})}
 {\max(S_{\rm pG}-\min(S_{\rm pG})}
\end{equation}
In mathematical expressions in running text ``/'' should be used for
division (not a horizontal line).

\section*{Acknowledgments}
Acknowledgments should be inserted at the end of the paper, before the
references, not as a footnote to the title. Use the unnumbered
Acknowledgements Head style for the Acknowledgments heading.

\section*{References}

Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in
the reference list (and vice versa).

\section*{\itshape Reference style}

Text: All citations in the text should refer to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Single author: the author's name (without initials, unless there
is ambiguity) and the year of publication;
